Description:
  'A study of jet production in association with W and Z bosons for a jet transverse momentum threshold of 30 GeV, using 35.9 ± 1.4 pb−1 of
proton-proton collision data at 7 TeV cms energy has been done. The study includes the measurement of the normalized inclusive rates of jets produced, as well as the ratios of cross-sections and the first test of the Berends-Giele scaling at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV.'
